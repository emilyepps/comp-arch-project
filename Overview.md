**Decisions We Make:**

3-31-11:

---

We chose a six-bit address width for instruction memory file, yielding 2<sup>6</sup> = 64 locations.  Our PC will implement bit addressing, incrementing by 1 to move to the next instruction.  Since our memory index in the pseudocode goes from $a0 = 16 to $a0 = 26, we will need at least 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 memory locations, each 16 bits wide according to our architecture specifications.

Set up timesheet and corrected/updated our schematic - complete with Forwarding unit, control unit, and hazard detection unit.

next time:
divide up work in terms of functions, etc.
set up subversion on Google Code
